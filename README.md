# RogueLikeIsh
This is my first personal project, creating a roguelike using libtcod in python
I followed this tutorial through section 5 to gain an understanding of the library and built from there.

TODO:
Implement Inventory Navigation
 loot system
 progression mechanics/new map generation
housekeeping: notes, refactoring etc

Bugs:
Fix flickering issue. Changing the render trigger would be a good solution to this. Alternatively, allowing event to only trigger entity render and make map render more static.
